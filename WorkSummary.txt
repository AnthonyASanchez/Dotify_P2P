Our application (app) allows users to play a song that exists in a text file.
In order to play a song, the user has to create an account by selecting "Sign Up" on the login page. 
Once all fields have been enterd and the account has been created, the app will navigate to the main page, consisting of a search page, playlist page
and profile information (settings) page. The search page allows users to search through a set of songs. Playlist page will display an empty list of playlists.
The user will have to select "Create Playlist" in order for the list to be displayed. When the user selects "Create Playlist",
the app he/she will enter a playlist name and then select "Create". User can repeat the process until he/she selects
"Close." The same thing applies for "Delete Playlist": delete as many playlists as the user wants until "Close"
is clicked. The settings page is where the user can edit their account information or log out.

If the user wants to log back into the app after logging out, he/she will have to enter their account information. If one or both of
the required fields had incorrect information, the user will have to select "Forget Password" and go through some security questions
in order to reset his/her password.
